      <p><strong>Semantic elements</strong> are sharp, to the point and tells what it does in an explicit manner.
      <p>The purpose of using semantic elements is to make it easier to understand the overall design of a web page, by showing what it does on the tag itself. When semantic elements are used, there is a clear self-explanation message of what is behind each tags. Out of all the semantic elements that I learned today, the most interesting one is the time tag, it makes the whole concept of semantic element easier to understand as a beginner in the field. When a number is placed, it can read as the time by the users, but when we put the time tag around the number, within that sentence, the browser will receive the exact same <em>interpretation</em>, too.</p>
